In general, documents with similar sentiments, would be close to each other in the embeddings feature space. This can become another method to judge the performance of sentiment analysis models.

In this work, we aim to perform a benchmark of recent sentiment analysis works and models, reproduce their results, and judge their performance in comparison to baseline methods.
